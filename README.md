# Design Engineering Projects by Team-CoreFive

Welcome to my Design Engineering Projects repository of Team-CoreFive. Here, I showcase our work on various projects across different semesters, including smart device development and drone automation with obstacle avoidance.
I was the the Team Leader for the whole Design Engineering journey and it was my responsibility to watch over the team's collaborated efforts and guide them in the right direction.

## Semester 3: Smart Device for Refrigerator Inventory Tracking

In this semester, we embarked on a project to create a smart device that efficiently tracks the materials stored in a refrigerator. Our goal was to develop a system that would not only monitor the contents but also provide useful insights.

- **Smart Refrigerator Inventory Tracking**: We designed a smart device capable of tracking the items stored in a refrigerator. This device will have used utilized sensors and data processing to keep an accurate record of the materials.

- **Food Product Classification**: As part of this project, we worked extensively on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This model was trained to classify different food products, enabling precise inventory management.

- **Date vs. Beetroot Classifier**: To demonstrate our system's accuracy, we created a specialized classifier. This classifier distinguished between dates and beetroot, a challenging task due to the visual similarities between these items.

## Semester 4, 5, and 6: Drone Automation and Shortest Path Algorithm

Our journey continued into the subsequent semesters, where we delved into the fascinating world of drone automation and pathfinding algorithms.

- **A-Star Algorithm for Pathfinding**: We explored and implemented the A* algorithm, a widely used pathfinding algorithm. This algorithm allowed us to determine the shortest and most efficient routes between two points, all while avoiding obstacles.

- **Mask R-CNN for Object Detection**: Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, we integrated Mask R-CNN into our projects. This technology enabled our drones to detect and identify obstacles in their path accurately.

- **Mask R-CNN Obstacle Detection**: Our team developed a custom Mask R-CNN model for identifying obstacles during drone missions. This model significantly improved our drone's ability to navigate complex environments.

- **A-Star Path Planning with Obstacle Avoidance**: In a groundbreaking demonstration, we tried to combined the power of the A* algorithm with the obstacle detection capabilities of Mask R-CNN. Our model could now autonomously chart the quickest routes while ensuring obstacle avoidance.
